Chapter ideas:
    2-D sidescroller
    Podracing
    Chess game with Death

God Mode
    unlimited ammo
    cannot die, but neither will you truly live
        HP still reduces, possible negative HP. If God mode exits while HP<=0, death
        -must heal before exiting God mode
    Can see defeated enemies as ghosts
    Cannot communicate with living NPCs
    boosts chance to hit by 5 pts
    Cannot level up as there is none higher than God
    Will not pick up items as a God has no need for earthly posessions

    Quadrumvirate or Quadrinity
        Holy Ghost mode:
            commune with ghosts
            resurrect the dead
            impregnate virgin to create The Child
            bless the living so they will ascend to Heaven at death instead of becoming a ghost
            cannot interact with the material world (except to impregnate)
        The Child mode:
            miracles = [multiply bread, walk on water]
            can die
        The Father mode: previous god mode stuff
        The Cousin mode: TBD
